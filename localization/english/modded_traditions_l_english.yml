 #Traditions
 assyrian_path_1:0 "Reformation of Chariot Division"
 assyrian_path_1_desc:0 "One of the first decisions the rulers of Mesopotamia made after the worst of the crisis had passed was to reform the chariot division.

 assyrian_path_2a:0 "New chariot improvements"
 assyrian_path_2a_desc:0 "Contrary to the old Bronze Age chariots which had to be disassembled and transported, new chariots could easily travel even distances of several days long."

 assyrian_path_2c_desc:0 "If a city did not surrender to the Akkadians before the assault (usually they asked several times), it was plundered, destroyed and its inhabitants deported deep into the empire.

 assyrian_path_end_bonus:0 "Imperial Army"
 assyrian_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The Assyrian army was the pride of its people. This can be seen in the number of paintings and reliefs dedicated to the Ashur soldiers. Until the time of Rome, there was probably no other such army in the world. "

 iranian_path_2b:0 "Bridges over the sea"
 iranian_path_2b_desc:0 "Nothing was impossible for the Persians. There were no obstacles to cross the mountains or the sea.

The construction was completed without any further obstacles."
 iranian_path_3b:0 "Persian Homeland"

 italian_path_6a:0 "Triplex acies"
 italian_path_6a_desc:0 "The Romans adapted the phalanx to the terrain of Iberia, where it was sometimes necessary to break the formation due to uneven terrain. To do this, they divided it into parts and applied a trilinear arrangement. The youngest soldiers were in the first line, the older ones in the second, and finally the veterans called triarii. In a loss report, the first line might have retreated through the gaps in the pattern and the second would replace it. The system with minor changes survived until the end of the empire."

The early roads were about 8 feet wide (about 2.4 meters), later this number was increased to 12 so that the two wagons could pass each other without affecting pedestrian traffic. Tradition and law strictly regulated vehicle traffic in cities. Commercial vehicles, for example, could only be driven at night."
 italian_path_4bs:0 "Copying Phoenicians"

 italian_path_5c:0 "Federati"
 italian_path_5c_desc:0 "In the case of units in which the Romans did not specialize, they used the services of the so-called federati, i.e. allied forces. For example, during a rebellion in Gaul, Caesar had to replace Gallic cavalry with Germanic cavalry."
 italian_path_6c:0 "Spoils of war"
 italian_path_6c_desc:0 "The Romans were a society like any other at the time and their economy needed slaves.

 zagrosian_path_2:0 "Mountain chariots"
 zagrosian_path_2_desc:0 "Through contact with the culture of the fertile crescent, the Zagros peoples learned Mesopotamian tactics and were excellent at using the chariot in combat."
 zagrosian_path_3:0 "Highlanders"
 zagrosian_path_3_desc:0 "The mountains are of course the favorite battlefield for the Zagros highlanders. Fighting in them is very difficult for a person who is not used to it, especially the pressure makes them tired faster and is less effective in combat."
 zagrosian_path_2a:0 "Kassite chariot traditions"
 zagrosian_path_2a_desc:0 "The Cassites were quite an enigmatic people and little exact information about their army has survived, but we know that they were well-known horse breeders in the bronze age (we know this from the Egyptian pharaoh's letter complementing the breeding in Babylon)."
 zagrosian_path_3a:0 "Tribal organisation"
 zagrosian_path_3a_desc:0 "Kassite society had a clan organization. Presumably, King Karduniash (aka Babylon) had to share power with many smaller clan leaders in the form of feudal relationships. They also had their own less regular forces."
 zagrosian_path_4a:0 "Bowmen"
 zagrosian_path_4a_desc:0 "We know that in the Iron Age, archers made up a large percentage of the Kassite force. Kassites were often hired by the rulers of the Persian Empire as mercenaries. It is said that the rulers of Persia paid them tribute to keep order on the mountain trails."
 zagrosian_path_2b:0 "Elamite bow"
 zagrosian_path_2b_desc:0 "Few know that it was from the Elamites that the inhabitants of Mesopotamia learned archery. Already Akkadians write about equipping the army with the so-called Elamite bow (probably a recurve bow)."
 zagrosian_path_3b:0 "Infantry of elam"
 zagrosian_path_3b_desc:0 "The Elamite infantry was very well trained and could use complex formations as we know from the compliments of the Babylonians as they fought hand in hand against Assyria."
 zagrosian_path_4b:0 "Mobile army"
 zagrosian_path_4b_desc:0 "The elam army was able to move very quickly. They surprised an opponent who did not expect the enemy to appear at such a pace. Apparently, they used a large number of carts for this purpose."
 zagrosian_path_5b:0 "Metal ores"
 zagrosian_path_5b_desc:0 "Due to their access to metal ores, the Elamites were usually quite well endowed. The first priority of many Mesopotamian empires was to master these deposits."
 zagrosian_path_6b:0 "Aryan influences"
 zagrosian_path_6b_desc:0 "The close presence of the Aryan tribes meant that the cavalry was also part of the Elamite army. It was probably formed similarly to Assyria, at first from mercenaries to then familiarize its own soldiers with the new tactics."
 zagrosian_path_end_bonus:0 "Zagrosian hillmen"

 germanic_path_2:0 "Seasoned fighters"
 germanic_path_2_desc:0 "At that time, there were recorded the existence of warriors who were said to have lived by the sword, but were not recruited from the peasantry. During the Battle of the River Tollense, many dead had healed injuries from many previous battles."
 germanic_path_3:0 "Martial culture"
 germanic_path_3_desc:0 "Warriors have been held in high esteem in Germanic culture since we have any sources on them. This indicates that most of the tribe had military training and were able to handle weapons. The Romans left a record of women among the combatants."
 germanic_path_4:0 "Hunters from the North"
 germanic_path_4_desc:0 "In addition to spears and axes of all kinds, the rock drawings also show bows as the main ranged weapon of Germanic warriors. This is not surprising given the nomadic nature of their culture at the time."
 germanic_path_4a:0 "Battle ax"
 germanic_path_4a_desc:0 "Contrary to appearances, the long ax is not easy to use as a weapon and its use requires practice and a long training. Consequently, he was the weapon of mainly richer and more experienced warriors. The masters of this weapon were even able to repel the attacks of the opponent's cavalry."
 germanic_path_5a:0 "Training and discipline"
 germanic_path_5a_desc:0 "When the armies of Rome began to clash with germaniums, they were surprised that a barbarian opponent could use advanced tactics and had excellent knowledge of the enemy. Apparently, during the meeting with Caesar, the Germanic leader made it clear to Caesar that he knew perfectly well that he had enemies in the capital, by using this fact he managed to provoke the Romans into a fight during the negotiations."
 germanic_path_6a:0 "Assault"
 germanic_path_6a_desc:0 "The capture of forts from enemy tribes was no stranger to Germanic warriors. Due to the lack of technical knowledge needed to build complex siege machines, the method of starving the enemy or assault was used. The fearless Germanic warriors in the battle frenzy (sometimes aided by herbs) were unstoppable."
 germanic_path_4b:0 "Long boats"
 germanic_path_4b_desc:0 "The Hjortspring boat best reflects the appearance of boats from the fashion action period. The early Germanic ships were not huge, but it was not size here, but speed, so that you could attack by surprise and leave quickly in the event of overwhelming resistance."
 germanic_path_5b:0 "Berserkers"
 germanic_path_5b_desc:0 "Some historians look to the origins of berserkers in the napola of animistic cults found in northern Europe. The most popular were the boar, bear and wolf cults. Such groups of warriors can be seen on the Trajan's column where they appear as allied troops."
 germanic_path_6b:0 "Germania"
 germanic_path_6b_desc:0 "Since the Fall of the Bronze Age, the Germanic expansion to the South began. The forested areas of Germanania made it difficult for the armies unfamiliar with the local routes to move. It was not difficult to set up an ambush in such terrain, and the few routes that were unfamiliar with their location were easy to control."
 germanic_path_end_bonus:0 "Fury of the North"
 germanic_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "When someone has a hard-to-live and dangerous homeland behind his back, he has no choice but to fight for a better tomorrow for his people. The migrating Germanic tribes could only go ahead, and if there was a need, they could use an ax to fight for a new home."

 balto_lusatian_path_2:0 "Slavic connection?"
 balto_lusatian_path_2_desc:0 "Due to the similar structure of settlements, scientists speculate that the Slavic culture may have had roots in the Lusatian culture, and early Slavic warriors were most often depicted as axemen."
 balto_lusatian_path_3:0 "Simpliest wepon"
 balto_lusatian_path_3_desc:0 "A large part of the warriors had to come from conscription, and those, as it was in other sedentary cultures during this period, were most often armed with spears, the simplest weapon with which to arm warriors cheaply."
 balto_lusatian_path_3a:0 "Trade from Greece"
 balto_lusatian_path_3a_desc:0 "We have evidence that the Lusatians had intensive contacts with the Greeks, as goods from the south were found in the remains of settlements, therefore, although most of the warriors were light infantry, they were well armed."
 balto_lusatian_path_4a:0 "Chariot figurines"
 balto_lusatian_path_4a_desc:0 "In Lusatian art, the chariot motif appears frequently enough to be able to recognize that the local chiefs used this unit in battle, and not just ridden it on holidays."
 balto_lusatian_path_5a:0 "Fortified settlements"

 balto_lusatian_path_6a:0 "Threat from the east"
 balto_lusatian_path_6a_desc:0 "In the later Iron Age, the Cimmerians were defeated by the Scythians and pushed to the Middle East and Europe. The threat from migrating nomads meant that the strongholds began to be strongly fortified with wide moats and additional ramparts."
 balto_lusatian_path_3b:0 "Forests of Eastern Europe"
 balto_lusatian_path_3b_desc:0 "Even today, one third of Poland's territory is covered by forests, and once you entered the forest, you might never have left. It was in such an environment that the cultures of the Northeast came to live. In clearings scattered in the forest, hence the name Poland from fields among forests (pole means field)."
 balto_lusatian_path_4b:0 "Along the Baltic"
 balto_lusatian_path_4b_desc:0 "The ancestors of the Balts lived further along the shores of the Baltic Sea. The Roman chronicles called them Aestia. The Balts and the Slavs were strongly related to each other as was the future culture that developed side by side."

 #Traditions
 thracian_path_1:0 "Thracian peltasts"

 thracian_path_2:0 "Warrior of thrace"
 thracian_path_2_desc:0 "The Thracians used many kinds of weapons, from clubs to longswords. Their national weapon, which almost every self-respecting Trak had, was a sica, that is a long (approx. 40 cm) curled knife perfect for podżynania. In Rome, it became popular with assassins and bandits, as well as with radical Jewish groups such as the Sicarians."
 thracian_path_3:0 "Chariots"
 thracian_path_3_desc:0 "The proximity of Middle Eastern cultures meant that the Thracians started using chariots quite early. They were light chariots that could take up to two people."
 thracian_path_3a:0 "Greek influence"
 thracian_path_3a_desc:0 "The closeness of the Greeks meant that the cultures living in the vicinity of Mycenaean Greece (like the Phrygians) adopted many customs and organizational forms, such as nomenclature (titles such as lavagetas and wanaktei in Greek wanax, and in English king)."
 thracian_path_4a:0 "Martial culture"

 thracian_path_5a:0 "Thracian cavalry"
 thracian_path_5a_desc:0 "In the later Iron Age, due to the proximity of the Scythians, the Thracians learned how to fight nomads, creating solid cavalry units or tactics like barricades made of carts (as in westerns)."
 thracian_path_6a:0 "Mercenary traditions"
 thracian_path_6a_desc:0 "The excess of warriors at home meant that the mercenary profession was very popular and promoted (so that out of boredom they would not think to rebel)."

 thracian_path_3b_desc:0 "In the years leading up to the fall of the Hittite Empire, Thracian tribes like the Phrygians crossed the Bosphorus in large numbers, taking over many local customs, such as Cybele cult and archery."
 thracian_path_4b:0 "Abandoned cities"
 thracian_path_4b_desc:0 "The Hittites left many cities and even fortifications intact when they departed. They only set fire to temples and, more importantly, buildings, indicating that it was an organized evacuation. This allowed the Phrygians to make a rapid cultural leap over the course of several decades."
 thracian_path_5b:0 "Fortifications of Gordion"
 thracian_path_5b_desc:0 "The acquired knowledge was used by the new inhabitants of Anatolia to build real wonders of defensive architecture of that time with huge towers like in Gordion, the largest city of Phrygia."

 #Traditions
 grekoid_path_1:0 "Tribal wariors"
 grekoid_path_1_desc:0 "The war in Greece during the dark ages was largely small-scale, with clan-bound groups of warriors. It must be remembered that the crisis of the end of the Bronze Age hit Greece the hardest and the organized state organisms had to be re-established."
 grekoid_path_2:0 "Warrior traditions"
 grekoid_path_2_desc:0 "The Greeks saw it as their duty to fight to protect their small homelands and their interests. In many regions, service was even an obligation imposed by the state."
 grekoid_path_3:0 "Greek chariots"
 grekoid_path_3_desc:0 "The Greek armies used small chariots to break up infantry formations. Later in the gression regions that were less mountainous like the Thessaly, horses began to be bred and horsemen were used to protect infantry formations from flanking."
 grekoid_path_3a:0 "Hoplite"
 grekoid_path_3a_desc:0 "Around the 8th century BC we have the first evidence of fighting in the usual style. The heavily armed hoplites formed the backbone of the armies of Greek cities. In many cases, they were armed by the state and their appearance and paintings on their shields had a shocking effect. After all, who would like to throw themselves at the wall of iron pressing right at you."
 grekoid_path_4a:0 "Greek engineers"
 grekoid_path_4a_desc:0 "The famous Greek ingenuity was manifested not only in civil but also military use. The Greek states competed in inventions to defend or break through the enemy's fortifications."
 grekoid_path_5a:0 "Greek peltasts"
 grekoid_path_5a_desc:0 "The battle was often opened by a duel of skirmishers called peltasts. It was about taking the best starting position for the fight, and because it was held mainly in close combat, it was extremely important."
 grekoid_path_6a:0 "Little homeland"
 grekoid_path_6a_desc:0 "The struggle was mainly for the few scraps of arable land that were increasingly coveted by the polis, which began to overpopulate towards the end of the Iron Age. The fighting style practiced by the Greeks meant that it was best for them when it took place in the open."
 grekoid_path_7a:0 "Colonies"
 grekoid_path_7a_desc:0 "Maybe you don't see it on the map at first glance because of the sea, but the Greeks were a very expansive people. Their homeland could not feed the surplus population, so colonizing overseas lands was the only option left."
 grekoid_path_3b:0 "Cretan Archers"
 grekoid_path_3b_desc:0 "The people of Crete and many Eastern peoples related to the Greeks, like the Philistines, adopted the use of the bow through contacts with the East. The Cretans had a reputation for being the best archers in the Mediterranean."
 grekoid_path_4b:0 "Sea traders"
 grekoid_path_4b_desc:0 "After the fall of the Minoans, the Greeks assumed their role as merchants linking the western and eastern Mediterranean basins. It was a very lucrative source of income for them and some polis began to specialize in the control of maritime trade, such as Syracuse or Athens, and invest heavily in naval forces. The Greeks, however, were not the only traders and had competition in the form of the Phoenicians with whom they had to compete at every step."
 grekoid_path_5b:0 "New ship types"
 grekoid_path_5b_desc:0 "The development of shipping and rivalry with the Phoenicians meant that war fleets began to be expanded to fight for influence in the seas, which were getting tighter. To this end, larger and larger ships were built and adapted only to combat, not to trade as before."
 grekoid_path_6b:0 "Mega galleys"
 grekoid_path_6b_desc:0 "At the end of the Iron Age, the Greeks had already begun to build real multi-row colossi, and the rivalry with the Phoenicians turned into a real war for influence wherever possible. One such clash took place in the vicinity of Corsica, where Etruscan-Carthaginian forces were forced to retreat by less numerous Phokian units, which proves the craftsmanship of Greek seamen."
 grekoid_path_end_bonus:0 "Great colonizers"
 grekoid_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "At the beginning, nothing foreshadowed that the broken tribes fighting for scraps of land for cultivation would become a force with which empires had to count, but as they say, greatness usually has modest beginnings and after many hardships, Greek cities grew up on every shore of the Mediterranean Sea."

 illyrian_path_2_desc:0 "On the vase from the period it is clearly visible that the Illyrians used chariots in a light version and in surprisingly large amounts for the region. They had a crew of two people, i.e. a javelin and a coachman."
 illyrian_path_3:0 "Common soldier"
 illyrian_path_3_desc:0 "Most of the warriors were conscripted soldiers, most of them poorly armed, though not for cultural or tactical reasons such as sawmills, but because of the lack of metals in the south. In the North, things looked better with the recession of the presence of tin deposits."
 illyrian_path_3a:0 "Wepons of Illirians"
 illyrian_path_3a_desc:0 "Due to their proximity, the Illyrians also used the sica (a long curved knife of ancient assassins) as well as many types of axes. They were truly versatile fighters, and perhaps that is why they were employed despite their bad reputation."
 illyrian_path_4a:0 "First ships"
 illyrian_path_4a_desc:0 "The Illyrians experimented with ships as the Greeks were just getting out of the dark ages. The first of them had a construction similar to a horse (I and historians are still wondering if it is a horse because the drawing was freehand). The ships were mostly small and maneuverable."
 illyrian_path_5a:0 "Control over southern Italy"
 illyrian_path_5a_desc:0 "The Illyrians, taking advantage of the confusion of the late Bronze Age, invaded the south of Italy and settled in Sicily and on the eastern coast. It was made possible by fast boats thanks to which they could make lightning attacks and quickly disappear. Until the appearance of the Greeks, they practically ruled the coasts of Italy."
 illyrian_path_6a:0 "Issues with Rome"
 illyrian_path_6a_desc:0 "Huge pirate fleets and the impossibility of their control by the decentralized kingdoms of the Illyrians caused conflicts with Rome. During the construction of their fleet, the Romans did not use only Phoenician but also mainly Illyrian inspirations because they chose smaller and better units in maneuvering."
 illyrian_path_3b:0 "Northern tribes"
 illyrian_path_3b_desc:0 "The Castellari culture was completely separate from the Illyrian culture, but at the same time they had a lot in common. The inhabitants of the north certainly had a better supply situation which explains the flourishing and expansion of their culture during this period."
 illyrian_path_4b:0 "Castello"
 illyrian_path_4b_desc:0 "The people of Histria lived in huge Mycenae-like fortresses. This testifies to the intense contacts between both cultures even in an earlier period."
 illyrian_path_5b:0 "Bosut Culture"
 illyrian_path_5b_desc:0 "There are many cultures in the Balkans whose affiliation cannot be 100% sure. An example can be the Bosut culture of Serbia (they could be thracian we don't know for sure yet), where there were tin mines providing a quality difference between Castelieri and the Illyrian culture."
 illyrian_path_end_bonus:0 "Pirate lords of Dalmatia"
 illyrian_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The fighting style of the inhabitants of Dalmatia was strongly inspired by the native individualism of the local people.

 arabian_path_2:0 "Shepherds of Syria"
 arabian_path_2_desc:0 "Like the Israelites, the Arameans were mainly shepherds because their desert homeland was unsuitable for the cultivation of grain. The typical weapon of the shepherds was the slingshot and they were able to throw projectiles at the speed of a rifle, so they were not toys like today."
 arabian_path_3:0 "Deserts of Arabia"

 arabian_path_4a_desc:0 "Due to its location, Damascus quickly became the main opponent of Assyria in the region, and its armies, due to greater funds than other Aramaic states, were better equipped. He was a member of every anti-Assyrian coalition and the main point of resistance on the road to Assyrian domination in the Levant."
 arabian_path_5a:0 "Burdensome tactics"
 arabian_path_5a_desc:0 "In the process of conquering the cities, the Arameans used their mobility and the enemy's excessive dependence on irrigation systems. For example, they tried to capture Nineveh by cutting off the water supply to the city (they destroyed the aqueduct)."
 arabian_path_6a:0 "Diverse nature"
 arabian_path_6a_desc:0 "The division into many tribes differing in dialect and beliefs also had a positive effect.

 arabian_path_4b:0 "Camel cavalry"

As a result, the Sardinians got land in the vicinity of Akka where fragments of their architecture have remained to this day. The bible mentions that they were very good at handling the chariots, and the group led by Sisera was in the service of the ruler of Hazor."
 nuragian_path_3a:0 "Religious nation"
 nuragian_path_3a_desc:0 "Nuragians rarely meddled with foreign affairs and were very independent. They were characterized by high piety with shrines scattered throughout the island. Unfortunately, few names of their deities have survived."

 nuragian_path_6a:0 "Tin mines"
 nuragian_path_6a_desc:0 "The presence of tin and copper mines made the Sardinian warriors well-equipped. The Nuragic people had so much metal that the foundry industry flourished there, so we know very well what their warriors looked like (they left a lot of figurines)."
 nuragian_path_3b:0 "Balearic slingers"
 nuragian_path_3b_desc:0 "Unlike the Nuragic people, the Balearic mercenaries were especially valued for their slingshot skills (they were the best in the region). During the Punic Wars, they fought on both sides of the conflict, and both sides competed in offers."
 nuragian_path_4b:0 "Shardana"
 nuragian_path_4b_desc:0 "In the Early Iron Age, Nuragic colonies / bases were established all over the Mediterranean basin, including in Crete and the surrounding islands."
 nuragian_path_5b:0 "Nuragic ships"
 nuragian_path_5b_desc:0 "If the Nuragic ships looked a bit like their casts, they must have presented a truly terrifying sight. They were long and wide single-row boats with a horned beast at the front and a nurhage made of wood on the deck."
 nuragian_path_end_bonus:0 "Horned warriors"
 nuragian_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Were it not for Nuragic sailors, the world as we know it would not exist. They were one of the connections between the eastern and western Mediterranean basins, and their attacks allowed for the birth of new powers such as Phoenician cities and Assyria."
