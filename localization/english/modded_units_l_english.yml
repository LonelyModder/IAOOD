 axemen_heavy_desc:0 "The ax is definitely cheaper than the sword and, contrary to appearances, it can be used in many ways, e.g. two-handed axes can be used as a weapon against cavalry. Axemen were part of many armies of the period, e.g. Germanic rock drawings show warriors with one-handed and two-handed axes. "
 cavalry_camels_desc:0 "The first use of camels in battle was during the Battle of Qarqar in 853. B.C.E. by King Gindibu who was a member of the anti-Assyrian coalition. Assyria later itself began to use camels as both cavalry and draft animals. The camel can withstand a very long time without water and its scent scares the opponent's mounts. "
 cavalry_horse_archers_desc:0 "Horse archers from the Iron Age did not have saddles, so it was difficult for them to fire while controlling the horse, so the pictures show that they are paired and the second soldier holds the horse while the first one shoots. Saddles are a much later invention. Therefore, the rejection of chariots in favor of horses was a long process, not a single reform. "
 cavalry_light_desc:0 "Chariots could not be used effectively in rough terrain. Therefore, the rulers began to use cavalry for these purposes. The heavy cavalry developed later because of the smaller horses, which is why most period cavalry are lightly armed."
 chariot_heavy_desc:0 "Heavy chariots have been used extensively in Mesopotamian countries since the Bronze Age. Later in the Iron Age, heavy chariots began to be used, among others, by israeli army. They served, inter alia, to break up infantry ranks and as a mobile platform for archers. "
 chariot_light_desc:0 "Light chariots have been used since the Bronze Age as mobile platforms for archers. The Egyptian army mainly used light chariots. At first, due to their light construction, they were disassembled and moved to the battlefield, but later in the Iron Age this problem was solved. "
 elephant_african_desc:0 "African war elephants are biggest on earth and they are deffinetely the most dangerous of all ancient units. The Phoenician colonists quickly realized the power that these animals gave them, and after gaining independence from Tire, they began to use them to win their empire."
 elephant_forest_desc:0 "Forest elephants are the smallest of the elephants used for combat purposes. In Egypt and especially in Nubia, known since the Bronze Age. It was this unit that came to Raphia on the Ptolemaic side. No wonder they could not withstand the attack of their Indian fellow Seleucids in the service of the Seleucids."
 elephant_indian_desc:0 "In the hands of an efficient commander, they can wreak havoc in the enemy's ranks. They appear as the name suggests in India and have been used in local armies for centuries. When the Achaemenids conquered the Indus Valley, they also appreciated the strength of these animals."
 light_spearmen_desc:0 "Infantry equipped with spears, usuallyfrom compulsory conscription, but there were also volunteers. Shields and spears were all they could aford. Sometimes they were given more decent equipment if the ruler could afford it."
 light_swordsmen_desc:0 "The sword was usually an expensive weapon, and only the richer could afford it. However, it happened that soldiers were provided with it by the state for the campaingn. The shape of the sword depended on the enemies a country was facing. For example, Greek and Egyptian swords were tilted forward to be able to reach behind the enemy's shield."
 missile_archers_desc:0 "Armed with bow and light armor these units were not very effective on their own. However when deployed in support of heavy infantry they could add extra punch to an infantry assault. Archers had a greater range than slingers or skirmishers, but the training took a long time, hence countries with a tradition of using this weapon, such as nubia, also known as the Land of the Bow, had a greater advantage. "
 missile_spearthrowers_desc:0 "Skirmishers use light weapons to throw. The unit was mainly used against better armored enemies. The Romans have modified their javelins to bend in contact with the shield, making the opponent have to throw it away."
