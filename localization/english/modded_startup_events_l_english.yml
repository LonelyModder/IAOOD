 ia_startup.1.t:0 "War-torn Mesopotamia"
 ia_startup.1.desc:0 "Mesopotamia in the 10th century BC was a very dangerous place. Where only two centuries ago there were powerful empires, today there are only ruins and fighting warlords. \n In Babylonia, there was an invasion of Aramaic and Chaldean tribes, which shattered the position of the Kassites in the region. Their attacks focused mainly on temples and resembled attacks of the medieval vikings. At the time of the start of the modification, there was a rebellion by the inhabitants of Babylon, led by an Elamite immigrant, who adopted the local Akkadian culture and threw a foreign yoke from the Babylonians after four centuries. \n In the levant abandoned by the Egyptian army, the nomadic peoples from the Syrian desert and Sinai took the dominant position. Canaan was conquered, with the exception of the coastal cities and Jerusalem, by the tribes of Israel, who, after many hardships to defend themselves, chose Saul as their first ruler. After his death on the battlefield, a civil war broke out between his son, Ishbaal, and David, a talented general who managed to enlist international support in the form of Ammonite military commanders and Philistine mercenaries. At the same time, in Syria, the Arameans began to create states from which the kingdom of Aram-Damascus would emerge, the largest Aramaic state in the levant. \n Assyria, on the other hand, after the seemingly incessant Aramaic attacks, had to leave its recent territorial conquests in Syria and, after an exhausting war, its borders on the euphrates were broken. However, unlike other nations, their spirit did not collapse. Despite so many losses, there was no change of power, internal struggles and similar issues there. The Assyrians united under the banner of Ashur of their god-king (the Assyrian ruler was only a governor for them, the royal title was used only in diplomatic correspondence). After some time, the attacks stopped, and instead of the merchant culture, militaristic fanatics appeared who believed that their mission was to bring the chaotic world under the rule of Ashur by using all necessary measures."
 ia_startup.1.a:0 "Will hope arise from all this blood?"
 ia_startup.2.t:0 "Warlords, Priests and Pharohs"
 ia_startup.2.desc:0 "Things did not go well after the invasion of Egypt by the sea peoples. Ramses III, the winner of the Nile delta battle, was murdered by one of his wives, who hoped that she would use the unrest caused by the economic crisis to place her son on the throne. Due to the fact that the army stood firmly on the side of the rightful heir, the rebellion was suppressed, but power fell into the hands of an unprepared person, which resulted in a line of weak rulers when the state quickly needed someone to lead the people with a firm hand. \n This was the case until Ramesses XI, in the days of whom Libyans already made up a large percentage of Egypt's armed forces. During his reign in Thebes, the high priest was expelled, and he complained to Pharaoh. Unable to react, Ramses sent the Nubian corps to Thebes under the leadership of the viceroy himself. Amenhotep and Panehesi, the priest and the aforementioned governor, of course, after arranging matters in Thebes, quarreled and the high priest ended up in prison and state of emergency was introduced in the city. These events disturbed Pharaoh, and he ordered the Nubians to withdraw. Panehesi obeyed, but he probably took it badly because after some time the Nubian army marched north, where the battle took place at Kynopolis. The royal army forced the viceroy to retreat. The power in Thebes was taken over by Herhor, the commander of the victorious royal army, and when he died childless, another general Pianchi took his place. In the north, Governor Smendes seized power and moved the capital to Tanis. Years later, Pianchi wrote a letter in which he asked if Panehesi was still loyal to Ramses (which looks at least strange but we may not know everything). Nubia was never recovered again. \n Hundred years later in a divided country, Smendes' successors have to deal with a new challenge. A revolt of Libyan troops (which arose from Libyan immigrants who came under Ramesses III during the unsuccessful invasion in which they took part) that want to put their leader Osorkon on the throne. In Nubia, order reigns once again after the confusion caused by the power vacuum. The Napata chieftains plan to unite the country and rule inthe style of egyptian pharaohs in the north."
 ia_startup.2.a:0 "Will Egypt Know Peace Again? "
 ia_startup.3.t:0 "Traiders and Sailors"
 ia_startup.3.desc:0 "After the invasion of the sea peoples, Egypt was forced to leave the Levant. Many of the peoples who participated in the journey stayed in Canaan permanently. The local Canaanites, however, weakened by the invasion from both the sea and the desert, were pushed to the deep defensive. \n However, it was not so bad everywhere, the trading cities of Phoenicia managed to survive and even benefit from being freed from foreign powers that constantly demanded tribute. The city of Byblos, which previously had greater contacts with Egypt, gave way in importance to Tire, which became a colonizing power profiting from trade with rich Iberia. \n Things weren't going well south of Tire. Many territories fell under Israeli or Aramaic control with the exception of coastal cities. Philistines from Crete took power around Gaza, Ascalon, Ashdod, Ekron and Gath. The alliance of these cities called the Philistine Pentapolis was not only inhabited by newcomers, most of the Philistine subjects were Canaanite. Shortly before the events of the modification, the Philistines launched an attack on Beth-Shan and, at Gilboa, defeated Israel's forces, killing its king and three of his sons, which led to a civil war. \n The peoples of the Levant, however, no longer lived only in Canaan. As mentioned earlier, the Phoenicians founded a number of colonies on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, such as Gadir and Utica. New cities sprang up on the way to Iberia, but also a few colonie were created on the islands of the Aegean Sea. Through them, new technologies spread to the west like the alphabet. In Crete and Cyprus there were still remains of the Minoans but already in extinction. The last notable descendants of Minos seemed to be only in the holy land. "
 ia_startup.3.a:0 "Is the power of trade enough to revive civilization?"
 ia_startup.4.t:0 "The Kingdom of Saba"
 ia_startup.4.desc:0 "A common mistake I encountered was to use the name Saba as the name of the ruler mentioned in the Bible. Nothing could be more wrong. Saba is the name of the place, although we do not know its exact location, we have a few clues. \n The first suspect is, of course, the Sabaean state within the borders of today's Yemen. At that time, power was exercised by religious and secular leaders called mukarrib. Their power, however, was quite small and local rulers (malik or sheikh) often did not take them into account. Saba was a rich country, but it was more about trade than gold, so not everyone agrees with this location. \n Another candidate for this is the newly created state called D'mt or possibly Damot. If the name is without vowels, it does not mean that they did not appear, but that you have to guess them because not every writing system before alphabet had them. The state itself was strongly inspired by the Arab culture and religion, and there were gold mines nearby. To this day, the people of Ethiopia maintain that they have the true Ark of the Covenant, stolen from Jerusalem according to a biblical account by David's illegitimate son Menelik. "
 ia_startup.4.a:0 "So which location is the right one?"
 ia_startup.5.t:0 "In the Caucasus Mountains"
 ia_startup.5.desc:0 "After the fall of the Mitanni Empire, the Hurrians who lived there fled north and scattered among the local population, bringing with them the first seeds of civilization in the Lake Van region. From the west, another group of the population, fleeing the turmoil that hit Anatolia, decided to move to the east, reaching the regions north of the Nairi Sea (the name of Lake Van at that time). This group was the proto Armenians known at that time as the Hayasa and Urumu peoples. \n In the same time, Assyria made regular and devastating invasions in this region, which eventually forced the peoples living there to try to form a state that would defend them. \n In the north, in the area of ​​today's mainly western Georgia, under the influence of refugees from the Kaska nation, the first centralized state of Colchis (known from Greek myths) arose. Thanks to their achievements in the field of metalworking and farming, they managed to survive difficult times and develop. \n States such as Mannea have also developed around Lake Urmia on one of the trade routes leading east to Afghanistan. The Manneans were a Hurrian people with a hint of Kassite influence. Consequently, they developed horse breeding fairly early and supplied these animals to Assyria. In return, Assyria allowed them to live in peace."
 ia_startup.5.a:0 "But will they be able to defend themselves against Assyria?"
 ia_startup.6.t:0 "Highlanders from the Zagros Hills"
 ia_startup.6.desc:0 "The Kassite people appeared in Mesopotamia from the Zagros Hills after Babylon (Karduniash in kassite) was destroyed after the daring expedition of the Hittite ruler Mursilis. Their incredible achievement and merit was the centralization of Babylonian culture where from then on, instead of a resident of Sippar or Borsipa, all were Babylonians. Their rule lasted four centuries until Assyria appeared. According to the Assyrian version, the Babylonians violated the truce, but we do not know and we may not know what realy happened, it is only known that Babylon was destroyed and after this loss, the influence of the Kassites gradually collapsed until in the 10th century there was a revolt against the Bazi dynasty. The refugees fleeing Mesopotamia formed a new state in the foothills of the Zagros mountains called Namar. For so long ruling rulers, little is known about them apart from a special love for horses. The Egyptian pharaoh in letters praised their innumerable Babylonian breeds of these animals. \n East of the Cassites and Mesopotamia was Elam, who at that time was busy fending off attacks by newcomers to the region of Persians and Medes. As a result, the eastern capital of Anshan fell into decline and turned from a bustling metropolis into a city of several thousand. Instead, they managed to protect Susa, who was recovered after the fall of Karduniash. From then on, she became the headquarters of their culture."
 ia_startup.6.a:0 "Highlanders have always been strong people."
 ia_startup.7.t:0 "Land of the Aryans"
 ia_startup.7.desc:0 "The Aryans came from the steppes to the north and, in the Iron Age, spread over the Iranian highlands, pushing back or assimilating the peoples found there. In the first millennium BC, they split into two Avestan groups in the east (in present-day Afghanistan, western Pakistan) and Iranians in the west. In the latter group, the peoples of the Medes and Persians should be distinguished in particular, because their location near the Mesopotamian region exposed them to attacks from Assyria or Elam, but also forced them to gradually centralize the power structures. \n They were known for their equestrian skills and, for example, many medes were employed in the Assyrian army as cavalrymen. Another feature was the high tolerance which made them win over other cultures. It was not unusual for a Persian ruler to attend religious ceremonies at the Temple of Marduk or to finance the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. "
 ia_startup.7.a:0 "Perhaps the new arrivals will bring peace to the region."
 ia_startup.8.t:0 "Northern Horselords"
 ia_startup.8.desc:0 "The Scythians were often defined as the set of North Aryan peoples who inhabited the Eurasian steppe. This group actually comprised of more peoples than the Scythians themselves. Starting from the west to the north of the Crimea, the Cimmerians lived at that time, who, due to the advancing Scythian tribes from the northeast, began to prepare for migration to the west and south. In the Crimea, a semi-settled Taurian people lived, but from the north, in the forests that covered Ukraine at that time, there was a settled and related to the nomads from the south, Culture of the Black Forest. \n To the north of the Iranian Plateau, cultures of a slightly higher cultural level, such as Amirabad and the Chustians, lived. The first major cities were built there, mainly around the Ferghana Valley and the Aral Sea. \n The Tarym Basin was inhabited by a separate Indo-European people called Tocharians. they had inhabited it at that time for at least a millennium. It is difficult to get accurate data about their culture before the adoption of Buddhism, but it is known that it was mainly inspired by Chinese influences and one of the goddesses was Gun Ana. Tocharians also practiced mummification at that time. \n The steppe peoples were experts in horse breeding and were able to move rapidly due to their nomadic lifestyle. Their invasion of the Middle East, caused by the Scythian migration, left deep traces in the psyche of its inhabitants. For example, the biblical story of Gomorrah was probably inspired by the Cimmerian tribe of Gimiri who moved south of the Caucasus and founded the city of Gomara."
 ia_startup.8.a:0 "Everyone should be afraid of the rulers of the steppe."
 ia_startup.9.t:0 "Chaos in Anatolia"
 ia_startup.9.desc:0 "In an earlier era in Anatolia, the Hittite empire controlled or influenced almost every country in the region, but nothing lasts forever. We do not know exactly what was the reason, but from the reports that have survived, it can be concluded that the country was hit by a huge drought. The situation became so dramatic that the rulers of Hatusa were forced to ask for help from the Egyptians. However, sea and land supplies were cut off by the attacks of the sea peoples, which killed the country. \n The story of the city of Ugarit, a vassal of the empire and ruled by a family related to the king, can tell us more. Namely, the local governor was obliged to send all available troops and ships to various fronts. The ships were sent to Lycia, and the chariots to Hatusa. Some time later, a letter came from Cyprus that the ships had been taken over by the enemy and warned against letting them into the port. As the sailors captured by the enemy knew about the city's defense, King Ugarit began writing a desperate message to his sovereign asking for help. He didn't even have time to send her. The largest commercial port in the country and perhaps the region was razed to the ground in one day. \n The Hittites were forced to evacuate the population south. At one point, the power structures fell apart, leaving only the city-states fighting for the ruins of the empire as the last members of the ruling family looked at it from Carchemish. \n In Anatolia, the Luvians began to fight for the gap left by the Hittites against the newly arrived peoples from Thrace. The Phrygians, who took over the abandoned cities and managed to rebuild them from the ruins, benefited the most. The strongest Phrygian state was Gordion, whose rulers began the process of unification, capturing, among others, Ankara just before the events of the modification. In the mainland, the Thracians have not yet divided into the Thracians and the Dacians. The Thracians lived on a very large area, and the Greeks joked that if not for their stabbing, they would pose a real threat to their militaristic culture."
 ia_startup.9.a:0 "Will the Hittites be reborn or will the new nation take their place?"
 ia_startup.10.t:0 "Post Mycenean Greece"
 ia_startup.10.desc:0 "If the situation in the Middle East after the fall of the Bronze Age was dire, it was nothing compared to that of the Greeks. It was so bad that in many places there was a civilization regression and the script used earlier has been forgotten. The reason for this was probably the collapse of trade related to the increase in piracy. The famine didn't help either. As a result, whole nations joined the peoples of the sea in the invasion of Egypt. The Greeks settled, inter alia, in Cyprus, in Cilicia, and one group also reached the holy land. There are assumptions in connection with some interesting entries in the Bible that the Dan tribe was of foreign origin (one of the tribes involved in the invasion of Egypt was called Dannuna) and the priests tried to integrate them peacefully. \n After the collapse of the Mycenaean confederation, according to reports, there was to be a great Dorian invasion, but no evidence of it was found. Many cities were attacked from the sea and not from the land. Hence the theory that social unrest had an internal basis. Doru was a Mycenaean term for the lower social class, so the peasant revolt could have been a natural consequence of the crisis. In some places, power was shared with the people to deal with it. It was during this period that the beginnings of democracy were born in Athens. \n There is also a linguistic change in favor of the theory of the internal nature of the crisis, namely the basileus from the position of a local governor has become synonymous with the king. Previously, the ruler was meant by the word wanax. The rulers, to justify their coming to power, coined the myth of Heraclids, i.e. the descendants of Heracles, and many of them began to derive their origin from them, for example, like the rulers of Sparta or Macedonia. "
 ia_startup.10.a:0 "But will they live up to the legend that they themselves began to believe?"
 ia_startup.11.t:0 "Aeneas Myth and Reality"
 ia_startup.11.desc:0 "The myth of Aeneas may not be widely known, but for the Romans it was one of the foundations of their culture. Their Trojan heritage was to justify their rule over Greece. But was this myth really born in Rome? \n We know, perhaps not with one hundred percent certainty, that the Etruscans could be the real source of this myth, as well as many other customs adopted by the Romans, such as triumph, fortune-telling, gladiatorial fights and many others. Rasenna, because that is what the Etruscan people called themselves, they were a pre-indo-european people with cultural connections with peoples living in the Aegean region, such as the Pelasgians or the Lelegs. Their homeland was rich in various metals and they managed to develop new irrigation techniques which made them a true regional power during the Iron Age. The only problem was their lack of unity. They formed a union of cities, but sometimes they did not respond to the threat to one of the members, as in the case of the fall of the city of Veii where Rome could be easily defeated, but other cities thought of Veia as a rival. \n Italians, on the other hand, came to Italy after the fall of the Bronze Age around the 11th century BC, pushing the ligures to the west and the Villanova culture to Tuscany (where Etruscan culture developed from it) and dividing the Illir who invaded southern Italy at that time into the tribes inhabiting Sicily and the Messapians. \n The Ligurians themselves are also an interesting case because their seat during the Bronze Age seemed to be the Po valley, because many regional names, including the name of the river itself, are of Ligurian origin. They are also accused of building cities like Brascia and Bergamo. "
 ia_startup.11.a:0 "But which people will survive?"
 ia_startup.12.t:0 "Pirates of the Western Mediterranean"
 ia_startup.12.desc:0 "The inhabitants of the western shores of the Mediterranean played a greater role in the history of the ancient world than is commonly believed. When we see a painting of a warrior with a horned helmet in Egypt, we do not often know that we are looking at a man from Sardinia, but what were they doing so far from home? \n The same as the inhabitants of any poor region with too large a population and wide access to the sea, that is, they attacked ships. Known in the East as Shardana, the Nuragic people were exquisite sailors and well-trained warriors. They served in the Egyptian army and fought on both sides of the conflict in battle with the peoples of the sea. We know from the number of sanctuaries on the island that they were a highly religious people. This is also indicated by the wearing of horned helmets, which at that time were generally worn in the west, but it was the inhabitants of Sicily who liked them especially and at least from the paintings it appears that they were commonly worn. The latest research shows that the horns were a symbol of the cult of twin gods, protective warriors, as indicated by statues with such helmets appearing in pairs. \n Another Sea People were the Illyrians, who probably also appeared in the Egyptian chronicles under the name of Shekelesh in response to piracy. During the crisis lasting from the 12th to the 10th century, they invaded southern Italy and Sicily where they probably shared the latter with people related to the Nuragic. With the advent of the Italians, the tribes inhabiting Sicily and the Messapians were separated. \n North of the Illyrians lived the Casterieri culture with clearly visible Mycenaean influences, which, unlike its southern neighbors, is pre-Indo-European and is sometimes confused with the Illyrians due to similarities."
 ia_startup.12.a:0 "Glory to the Mediterranean Vikings!"
 ia_startup.13.t:0 "Land of Gold and Tin"
 ia_startup.13.desc:0 "Ancient Iberia was famous for two things. First of all, the rich tin deposits, equally large of which are located far away in Afghanistan. At that time, they were in the possession of the Lusitans and peoples related to them. Another thing was the deposits of precious metals mainly in the south, where the Tartessos civilization flourished at the time. \n The Tartesians were a pre-Indo-European people strongly inspired by Phoenician culture, they even built Phoenician temples. The Canaanite influences flowed from the colonies on the route to the tin deposits. When the Greeks arrived in these areas, they allegedly found civilization open to commercial contacts. The name itself comes from the name of the main city, which may have been flooded in later years. It was most likely located near Huelva. \n Another related culture is the Iberians of the Iberian Levant. They served as brokers for the tin trade in an earlier era, but their civilization deteriorated as the routes shifted south. Iberian, Tartessos, and Nuragic cultures were closely related and, for example, the Nuragic dialect sounded like Iberian. This was a result of the Tartessian and Nuragic descent from the Iberians (the split occurred in the Bronze Age). \n The last pre-Indo-European culture of the peninsula is the Basques. Their formation is, according to the most probable theory, dated to the early Iron Age and was caused by the Celto-Iberian invasion. inaccessible regions of the Basque country allowed for the survival of their different language and culture from the rest of the Iberian peoples when their relatives from the south were Romanized. "
 ia_startup.13.a:0 "Will the resources of iberia allow them to survive? "
 ia_startup.14.t:0 "Celtic Expansion"
 ia_startup.14.desc:0 "According to some theories, we have been talking about Celts since the fifth century BC, but other scientists point out that in such a case the huge area that this culture covered would be impossible. That is why recently there are theories about the earlier origins of the Celts dating back to the Bronze Age and the Tumulus culture. According to them, the expansion was rather slow and gradual, and it was not always violent. many peoples adopted new customs voluntarily weaving elements of their own culture. \n This was the case, for example, in islands where no genetic traces of a single massive expansion had been found, and the Romans noticed linguistic similarities in areas of the southern coast disappearing inland. These similarities mainly concerned the culture of Belgae in the area of ​​present-day Belgium. \n The appearance of the Celts in Spain, on the other hand, was related to the Ligurian migration, pushed to the west by the Italians. Most Celticians probably adopted new customs voluntarily, as evidenced by the cultural closeness noted by the ancients with the Iberians. \n During the fall of the Bronze Age, a severe drought broke out in Europe and this may have caused a domino effect with the Celts as the first dice. Their pressure forced the Italians to migrate south, they pushed the ligurs west, and these pushed some of the Celts to Spain. Interestingly, the Celts were not the only Indo-Europeans in Iberia. Peoples like the Lusitans had arrived a thousand years earlier with the wave of Baker peoples. They underwent gradual celticization, although even in Roman times they were distinguished by the fact that their classification was a problem for the Romans."
 ia_startup.14.a:0 "Hunger pushes people to do both desperate and great deeds."
 ia_startup.15.t:0 "Cold Forested North"
 ia_startup.15.desc:0 "The first depictions of Germanic warriors show them often with spears, axes and bows. You can also see numerous images of long boats, many of which are still missing from ships from later eras but, as they say, greatness from modest beginnings. It can be concluded that it was already at that stage strongly militant and expansive culture. \n From the south, the Germanic people bordered the Celtic and Lusatian cultures. The latter is often accused of being a proto-Slavic culture. The evidence for this is, among others, architecture reminiscent of Slavic fortified settlements from the early Middle Ages or the cult of the sun present in these areas. Important places of this culture were Buch near Berlin and Biskupin in Poland, where there is a reconstruction of the settlement. It is worth mentioning that the discussion has been going on since the interwar period and it cannot actually be resolved unequivocally due to the number of migrations in the region in later years. The Lusatians maintained numerous trade contacts with places as far away as Greece. \n The Balts were probably also present in the region, as evidenced by the linguistic similarities between the Aestian (regional tribe) language and Latvian. "
 ia_startup.15.a:0 "So the north is not only forests and snow."
 ia_startup.16.t:0 "Aryan Invasion and Dravidans"
 ia_startup.16.desc:0 "Arjan's invasion of the Harrapan culture is quite a controversial topic. Only when the nomadic culture attacks the settled, it rarely manages to completely dominate the local population. Especially since Harrapan was much more than the newcomers, it is more likely that some customs were brought to areas of India, such as horse sacrifice or some deities, but local culture absorbed the newcomers over time. \n As the Harrapan culture collapsed earlier than the Bronze Age during the Early Iron Age, the first nations fighting for supremacy begin to form in India. One of them is Kuru, which is perhaps the oldest of them and is the subject of many legends such as the epic Mahabharata. Other important countries are the kosala or birthplace of Rama, and of course, Magadha, a warlike kingdom that was looked upon with reluctance at that time by its attempts to expand westwards. Magadha will be the country that will manage to form the first historical empire of India after centuries of efforts. \n Dravidian culture is precisely accused of being of the same family as Harrapan culture. This is argued, among other things, with the Harrapan-like language found in Tamil territory, as well as the Dravidian borrowings found in Sanskrit, which are more than Sanskrit borrowings in Dravidian, as I said before, when a smaller nomadic culture invades settled it is most often absorbed . At that time, countries also began to form in the South, and the improving situation in Mesopotamia meant the return of maritime trade, which influenced further waves of urbanization of the peninsula. "
 ia_startup.16.a:0 "So who will take over India."
 ia_startup.17.t:0 "Himalayas and Burmese"
 ia_startup.17.desc:0 "The term Kirata found in Sanskrit is a general term for the inhabitants of the Himalayas, and means mountain dwellers or a person of a lion character. \n The name itself probably came from the Sanskrit translation of the tribal name Kirant or Kiranti. The Vedans again did not consider the northern inhabitants to be complete barbarians, and appreciated their military skills. They also noted a certain level of civilization, although they were far from their southern neighbors. Inhabitants of the Assam area also had Tibetan ancestry at the time. According to legends, the kingdom of Pragjyotisha existed there to be replaced by the Hindu dynasty in later years. \n To the east of the Ganges delta, you could find Burmese tribes closely related to the Tibetans. Qiang people migrated to both regions to flee from the Chinese dynasties. "
 ia_startup.17.a:0 "Tough conditions make tough people."
 ia_startup.18.t:0 "Ancient Sri Lanka"
 ia_startup.18.desc:0 "Ancient Sri Lanka was home to the Vedda people long before the aryan and dravidian migrations. They worshiped the ancestral spirits of nae yakka and also had their own gods like the Kande Yakka. They mainly led a tribal lifestyle. To this day, the term vedda is said to be used on the island of people who share the same lifestyle. \n Wanniyala-Aetto because they are also known under this name, they were not only hunter-gatherers. In the 10th century BC, the island began to urbanize and the first cities of Anuradhapura and Aligala were established. Trade with Egypt was also confirmed, although it is not known whether the contact was direct or traded through intermediaries in the form of Damot and the Sabeans. Therefore, it can be assumed that there was at least one state on the island. This is also confirmed by myths like the Ramayana about the trip to the island carried out by Rama (the ruler of Kosala) to retrieve the kidnapped wife. "
 ia_startup.18.a:0 "And the island seemed to be off the beaten track. "
