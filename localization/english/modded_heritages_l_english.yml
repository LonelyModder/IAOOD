 #Modded Heritages
 egiptic_heritage:0 "Kemetic Heritage"
 egiptic_heritage_desc:0 "Egypt have a long and complicated history stretching back many centuries. We can devide it on old, middle, new and late kingdom with intermediate periods in between. Mod takes place during third intermediate period when after a couple of invasions by sea peoples egypt suffered centuries of civil wars, internal divisions and foreign occupations. The egyptians strongly believed change was a bad thing."
 levant_heritage:0 "Phoenician Heritage"
 levant_heritage_desc:0 "Phoenicians were the best sailors of the era. Their skills as seaferers and traiders allowed them to survived the invasions of the late bronze age. In the new world without the superpowers bullying them into submission maybe they will finally be able to forge their own empire."
 libyan_heritage:0 "Libyan Heritage"
 libyan_heritage_desc:0 "Herodotus devides Lybians on western, more agricultural communities and eastern nomadic tribes. Sharing border with pharonic Egypt the Libyans adopted many elements of egyptian culture, and vice versa. During the time period of the mod the instability in egypt allowed them to terrorize the country of the pharohs from the delta to Thebes."
 nubic_heritage:0 "Kushite Heritage"
 nubic_heritage_desc:0 "Nubians have long history of being invaded by egyptians for their gold, preacious metals and excellent archers. Only during the periods of weakness they were able to pose a threat to their northern neighbours. The periods of egyptian domination also tought nubians many things about the economy and warfare. It's time to put it to good use."
 ahlamu_heritage:0 "Aramean Heritage"
 ahlamu_heritage_desc:0 "During the previous age aramean tribes lived on the edges of civilised world. They were never able to overcome the much more numerous nations and empires. But the times changed and now old powers are no longer an obstacle. Everyone fears the hordes of Ahlamu."
 arabian_heritage:0 "Arabian Heritage"
 arabian_heritage_desc:0 "The Arabs, as a separate people, first appeared during the Aramaic-Jewish coalition war with Assyria in 853 BC, where their unit of a thousand camel riders supported the coalition's troops. They were a people divided into many tribal states ruled by kings called malik. Rarely, there was a religious leader called mukarrib who had slightly more authority."
 hattian_heritage:0 "Hattian Heritage"
 hattian_heritage_desc:0 "A unique feature of the Hittite Empire was the number of treaties they concluded with their partners. Hence it is known, for example, that the city of Ugarit paid more tribute in exchange for the military protection of the city. They had a reputation of being honest. The only problem was the lack of religious syncretism and the divided nature of Anatolian society."
 grekoid_heritage:0 "Greek Heritage"
 grekoid_heritage_desc:0 "The Greeks were a society that valued freedom highly and were able to protect it against adversity or common sense, even in the face of highly overwhelming opponent forces. Many Polis had compulsory military service and could mobilize surprisingly large forces for their size. The only drawback was the relatively long reaction time due to the love of political debates. In the Late Iron Age, even Sparta had a democratic government and kings held limited functions (mostly served as military commanders)."
 minoic_heritage:0 "Minoan Heritage"
 minoic_heritage_desc:0 "After the conquest of Crete by the Greeks, the Minoans did not immediately disappear from the pages of history. Their descendants tried to preserve the remnants of this great civilization in enclaves scattered around the eastern Mediterranean. Perhaps the most famous heirs of Cretan palaces are the philistines. "
 ashurite_heritage:0 "Ashurite Heritage"
 ashurite_heritage_desc:0 "The Assyrians lived in a country without serious natural borders. This, in combination with the frequent invasions of foreign powers, made Assyrian culture heavily militarized. Every citizen was obliged to perform military service and, if necessary, to defend the country."
 mardukite_heritage:0 "Mardukite Heritage"
 mardukite_heritage_desc:0 "To say that Babylonia was multicultural is like saying nothing. In one surviving court case, officers of Akkadian, Aramaic and Kassite origin testified while their king was elamite, so they had no problem with cultural integration. "
 dilmunite_heritage:0 "Dilmunite Heritage"
 dilmunite_heritage_desc:0 "Dilmun was the subject of many Akkadian and Sumerian legends. Its inhabitants lived off the trade between India and Mesopotamia, which brought them a fabulous income. That must have made quite an impression on the visitors from the West. "
 hurrian_heritage:0 "Hurrian Heritage"
 hurrian_heritage_desc:0 "Hurriann are already mentioned during the reign of the 3rd dynasty of Ur. They once formed the Mittani Empire in upper Mesopotamia, possibly of a strongly feudal character. After the turmoil of the Fall of the Bronze Age, they withdrew to the mountains where they were subjected to constant attacks from Assyria, regaining its former power. They were known in Mesopotamia for the first to introduce a chariot with spoked wheels."
 kassite_heritage:0 "Kassite Heritage"
 kassite_heritage_desc:0 "The Kassites left a profound mark on the history of Mesopotamia. Their dynasty ruled Babylon (after the Karduniash helmet) for more than four centuries, which is quite an achievement for this region and shows high administrative skills. They were also known for breeding horses, reportedly the best from Egypt to Elam (according to the Egyptian pharaoh)."
 elamitic_heritage:0 "Elamite Heritage"
 elamitic_heritage_desc:0 "The Elamites are the eternal enemies of the inhabitants of Lower Mesopotamia. Nobody remembers the beginning of the fighting anymore, although the changing political conditions will make former enemies shake hands. They were known for their high-quality weapons due to the proximity of metal ores, as well as because of their mountain origin, they felt comfortable fighting in the mountains that were rarely conquered by the Mesopotamian invaders."
 caucasic_heritage:0 "Caucasian Heritage"
 caucasic_heritage_desc:0 "The Caucasus region experienced a real development at that time. The first centralized country of Colchis was established there, metalworking was perfected and advanced irrigation techniques were introduced."
 luwian_heritage:0 "Luwian Heritage"
 luwian_heritage_desc:0 "The Luwians were a people who lived between the Hittites and the Greeks, and they had the features of both of these cultures. They shared a Hittite aversion to syncretism in religious matters, which led to regionalisms in Luvian society and a rarity in the formation of larger states in this region. At the end of the Bronze Age, their culture began to influence strongly the Hittite culture and gradually replaced it completely during the Iron Age. They were a people with a strong sense of independence, and they fought fiercely for it."
 iranic_heritage:0 "Iranian Heritage"
 iranic_heritage_desc:0 "The Iranians proved to be a highly tolerant nation and it served them well when they began to rule the multicultural Middle East. They were even known to participate in religious ceremonies of other faiths, and perhaps the most famous gesture of goodwill was the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem by Cyrus. "
 medic_heritage:0 "Median Heritage"
 medic_heritage_desc:0 "The Medes appear as the target of the Assyrian rulers' expeditions to obtain war horses widely bred in those parts for their army. The Assyrians had to admire their skill in battle because they always spoke with respect for them. The name itself probably expresses their central location on trade routes, but this is not known for certain. "
 avestan_heritage:0 "Avestan Heritage"
 avestan_heritage_desc:0 "The Avestan tribes of Eastern Persia were the link between the Iranians and India. This rich area flourished in trade with both India and in the trade of tin, the deposits of which on such a scale are comparable only to those in Iberia. The local tribes were very aggressive and disliked being ruled by strangers. Ever since the region appears in the Persian chronicles it is mentioned as rebellious."
 nuragian_heritage:0 "Nuragic Heritage"
 nuragian_heritage_desc:0 "The Nuragic people are perhaps best known as one of the peoples who ended the Bronze Age with their invasion of the lands of the Middle East. This people was full of excellent sailors and experienced, disciplined warriors. They were even employed as Pharaoh's bodyguard from the time of Ramses the Great. Their distinguishing feature is the horned helmet worn by almost all Nuragic warriors."
 axumitic_heritage:0 "Axumite Heritage"
 axumitic_heritage_desc:0 "During the Iron Age, the region from Nubia to Somalia flourished thanks to the trade route to India. The first countries like D'mt with the capital in Yeha were also founded. The region was religiously divided into African Nubian and Arab influences. The Damotans worshiped Arab gods and the temple of Ilmuqah, the Arab god of the moon, still stands in Yeha."
 scythian_heritage:0 "Scythian Heritage"
 scythian_heritage_desc:0 "The Scythian peoples were masters of the steppes. The Iron Age is the time of their expansion to the south. The Cimmerians had just destroyed the newly formed Frederick empire, and even managed to defeat the Assyrian army, which was quite an achievement. The Massagetae appeared in the east, who were also a serious obstacle to the expansion of the Persian Empire."
 hayasan_heritage:0 "Hayasan Heritage"
 hayasan_heritage_desc:0 "The Hayasa-Azzi confederation was for a long time a thorn in the side of the Hittite empire, and alongside the Kask people, they frequently raided the northern part of the empire. Just before the Fall of the Bronze Age, however, the Hayasa people disappear, and only the Azzi appear in the chronicles of Hattusa. According to one and quite probable theory, they migrated to the east and south where they gradually changed into today's Armenians under the influence of Hurrians."
 thracianic_heritage:0 "Thracian Heritage"
 thracianic_heritage_desc:0 "Were it not for their internal divisions and the clan nature of the Thracians, they would have easily mastered much of the ancient world, as the Greeks used to say. In the 10th century BC, they ruled the areas from the Carpathians to the Cilicia, and the Phrygians even managed to form a short-lived empire in central Anatolia with a heavily fortified capital, Gordion. "
 dravidic_heritage:0 "Dravidan Heritage"
 dravidic_heritage_desc:0 "The Dravidan is a very old nation. When the Akkadians took over the domination of Lower Mesopotamia after the Sumerians in the Indus Valley, cities with complicated drainage systems and special walls were built to prevent flooding during monsoons. After the Aryan invasion, part of Dravidans gradually absorbed the Aryans and took over some elements of their culture, while the rest was pushed east and south."
 illyric_heritage:0 "Illyrian Heritage"
 illyric_heritage_desc:0 "The Illyrians were excellent sailors, the first ships began to be produced in Dalmatia as early as the 10th century BC. The Roman navy was modeled, inter alia, on the Illyrian solutions. However, perhaps no less well-known for their wavering loyalty to the employer. The mercenaries of Illyria often changed fronts when offered more money."
 vedic_heritage:0 "Vedic Heritage"
 vedic_heritage_desc:0 "The Vedic tribes invaded the Indus Valley in the mid-Bronze Age. After centuries of fighting, the first kingdoms began to form at the start of the Iron Age, and the invaders took over many local customs by adding their own. The beginnings of the caste system known in later ages also appeared. "
 qiang_heritage:0 "Tibeto-Burmese Heritage"
 qiang_heritage_desc:0 "During the Iron Age, Tibet saw an influx of populations from northern China possibly fleeing the expansion of successive Chinese dynasties. Tibetans were known in India as an aggressive people. In the 10th century BC, the Salva tribe invaded the Kuru kingdom, weakened by civil war and cataclysm, destroying one of the oldest and most powerful Indo-Aryan states."
 tocharian_heritage:0 "Tocharian Heritage"
 tocharian_heritage_desc:0 "Tocharians are the easternmost group of the Indo-European population. The first mentions of this people come from Buddhist times, but from fragmentary accounts we know that their beliefs were probably inspired by the East with which they had business contacts. In pre-Buddhist times, they practiced mummification."
 celtic_heritage:0 "Celtic Heritage"
 celtic_heritage_desc:0 "After the fall of the Bronze Age, the Celts made rapid expansions from their headquarters along the Rhine and Northern Alps in all directions. In the 10th century BC, their range stretched from Iberia to Pannonia. Many peoples accepted their culture voluntarily, not always through expansion. However, they were known as a warrior nation."
 italic_heritage:0 "Italic Heritage"
 italic_heritage_desc:0 "Italians were a strongly militant people and service was considered a duty. They are relatively new to the region having come with the fall of the Bronze Age. Their culture was strongly inspired by Etruscan culture and they took over many customs and beliefs from them. A particularly interesting feature was the strong faith in fortune-telling, which was carried out according to the Etruscan prayer on many occasions."
 liguric_heritage:0 "Liguric Heritage"
 liguric_heritage_desc:0 "Ligurians were present in Italy for 1000 years before the events of the modification. Known at that time under the name of the Polada culture, they occupied the area of the Po Valley. From those times, many local names have remained, such as the name of the river itself, or the cities of Bergamo and Brascia. They were good archers and metallurgists."
 iberic_heritage:0 "Iberian Heritage"
 iberic_heritage_desc:0 "Most of the Iberians lived in fortified settlements called oppida. Those living closer to the coast lived in larger towns, in the Iron Age the argaric culture that flourished during bronze age declined somewhat in favor of the Tartesians living in the southern part of peninsula. The Iberians were known as mercenaries and took part in many famous war campaigns. They lived, among other things, from trading in tin and gold, which were plentiful in Iberia."
 bakeric_heritage:0 "South Baker Heritage"
 bakeric_heritage_desc:0 "Tribes like the Lusitanians and their neighbors were often counted among the Celtic tribes, but upon closer examination of their culture one could raise doubts. In recent years it has been established that the Lusitans were part of an earlier Bronze Age migration. They were a belligerent people known for their use of guerrilla warfare."
 nbaker_heritage:0 "North Baker Heritage"
 nbaker_heritage_desc:0 "One theory of the emergence of Celtic culture on the islands was the invasion theory that the Celtic tribes came in waves one after another. The problem is that there is no genetic evidence yet. Hence the new theory about the peaceful adaptation of Celtic culture by the inhabitants of the Atlantic coast and the British Isles, who were in close trade relations with each other, which in turn helped in the transfer of new ideas. The Pictish tribes and the people of Ireland begin to leave a mark in the chronicles after the arrival of Rome. They were known at that time for frequent and devastating raids on areas controlled by the Romans. "
 bosquian_heritage:0 "Vasconic Heritage"
 bosquian_heritage_desc:0 "The Basques are a pre-Indo-European people who were probably separated from the Iberians during the Fall of the Bronze Age by migrating Celtic tribes. They are known for their sense of independence and dislike of foreign rule. The first written records of them appear during the Sertorian War. "
 thyrrenic_heritage:0 "Tyrrhenian Heritage"
 thyrrenic_heritage_desc:0 "Before the Indo-Europeans migrated, the Etruscans and peoples related to them occupied the area from Italy to the western shores of Minor Asia. Etruscan culture stood at a much higher level than the Italian culture and had a great influence on it. The Etruscans preferred to expand primarily overland and developed highly efficient irrigation techniques."
 castelic_heritage:0 "Castelieri Heritage"
 castelic_heritage_desc:0 "The Praindo-European culture of Castellieri came from the sea in the Bronze Age and was mainly known for building heavily fortified hilltop towns. Mycenaean influences in their buildings (cyclopean walls) are visible at first glance. Probably the reason was the trade in tin mined in Serbia, which was the closest source for the Greeks."
 germanic_heritage:0 "Germanic Heritage"
 germanic_heritage_desc:0 "Already the first rock paintings from the era made by the Germanic tribes show the expansive and combative nature of the people of the North. In the Iron Age, they pushed southwards step by step to cross the Rhine in antiquity. They knew how to use complicated tactics, and years of inter-tribal fighting had taught them to be cunning."
 lusatian_heritage:0 "Lusatian Heritage"
 lusatian_heritage_desc:0 "The Lusatian culture had strong trade contacts with the Mediterranean world for such a distant area. They lived in fortified settlements on mountain tops or among swamps. There are disputes about whether this circle was proto-Slavic, but it has not been possible to prove it unequivocally due to many waves of migration."
 baltian_heritage:0 "Baltic Heritage"
 baltian_heritage_desc:0 "There are at least a few reasons for the recognition of the Aestian tribes as proto Balts, such as linguistic similarities. The name of amber in their language was glaesum which is similar to the Latvian glisis. The name of this tribe was probably derived from the name of the area of the mouth of the Vistula River, which they called Aistinmari."
 synaic_heritage:0 "Synaic Heritage"
 synaic_heritage_desc:0 "During the Iron Age, the peoples of Sinai emerged from their desert abode and conquered large areas of the Levant. The concept of monolithism also began to be adopted, that is, paying more attention to belief in one particular god, without denying the existence of the others. This caused many internal tensions but gradually united the earlier tribal structures around the ruler."
 veddic_heritage:0 "Vedda Heritage"
 veddic_heritage_desc:0 "The Vedda peoples were the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka. To this day, they are known for their hunting lifestyle and the ability to use a bow. Their name has become a general term for people who lead a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in Ceylon. If you believe the records, there was once a powerful state on the island and this may be because there were at the time indications of indirect trade relations with Egypt."
